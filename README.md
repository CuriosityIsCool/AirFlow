## Problem Description
Sometimes, The `Unable to render code block` problem arises due to the limitations of GitHub's rendering capabilities for larger files in some notebooks. (Some of my notebook files sizes are >1MB)

## Solution
If you encounter a notebook file that fails to render properly on GitHub, simply refresh the page! or download it and open it in local VS Code.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
